# Chess
Arduino chess project.

Under each position of the board there is a Reed switch. In each piece there is a neodymium magnet that ope the switch when the piece is on a box.
So I know the pieces' position on the board and I want to delovelope a Arduino's program to plot the game.

In this version: to resolve the problem of taking an other piece, I consider a double scan of the board. First without the enemy's piece, then moving the own piece.
